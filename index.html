      <p>I like bunnies, they are cute and fluffy</p>
      <h2>They get grumpy if you intrude on their space</h2>
      <p>When you adopt a rabbit, you quickly learn that they’re very particular about their territory. They need lots of space and have specific spots where they like to eat, sleep, and use the “bathroom” (kind of like humans!). Sometimes, if you invade a bunny’s space, he or she will grunt at you so that you know to back off.</p>
      <h2>Bunnies need to be brushed regularly</h2>
      <p>Bunnies shed like crazy and can get hairballs from grooming themselves, but they can’t cough them up like cats do. If they get a hairball, they may need to be taken to the vet to be treated (and possibly even operated on!), or they’ll die. So it’s very important to brush them regularly to remove the loose fur from their coats and prevent hairballs from forming in the first place.</p>
      <h2>Like humans, bunnies get bored easily</h2>
      <p>If you were trapped in a little cage with no friends or toys to play with, you might get lonely and bored, right? Well, rabbits are the same way. They need opportunities to socialize, lots of space to run around, and plenty of toys to keep them entertained. If left alone, they can become withdrawn or depressed.Some common household items can make for fun bunny games, like paper towel rolls and cardboard oatmeal canisters. Just fill them with timothy hay and watch as your bunny rolls, chews, and plays joyfully.</p>
      <h2>Rabbits purr when they’re content</h2>
      <p>They’re different from kitty purrs, but bunny purrs will melt your heart just the same. A bunny purr sounds almost like teeth chattering quietly or light chomping. Talk about cute, huh?</p>
      <h2>Every bunny has a unique personality, just as you and I do!</h2>
      <p>Every rabbit is different. They can take a long time to get to know, and it’s hard to tell if they will get along with another animal companion—even another rabbit. Making sure two rabbits get along takes a lot of time and energy. It can be dangerous to put two of them together who don’t know each other yet, so keep that in mind if you plan on adopting more than one rabbit.</p>
